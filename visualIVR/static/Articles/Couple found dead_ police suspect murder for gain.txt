A 70-year-old retired pilot of Indian Air Force and his wife were found murdered in their villa in Bidadi near Ramanagaram on Tuesday. The police suspect that it is a case of murder for gain. Meanwhile, the suspected assailant, who is the caretaker of the pets of the deceased, is on the run, soon after the incident came to light.

The deceased have been identified as Raghuraman, 70 and Asha, 63, who hailed from Tamil Nadu and were working in Delhi. The couple settled down in Bidadi and had been living in a private villa for six years, while their children live in Delhi.

The murder came to light when Raghuramanâ€™s son called up the security and asked him to check the house as his parents were not answering phone calls. Thereafter, the security guard came to the villa and found the pet caretaker at home. The caretaker was hired six months ago to take care of a stray dog and a cat.

He told the security guards that the couple had gone to Bengaluru and went out. The security guard informed the same to his son, who, on suspicion asked them to go inside and check. The employee took them inside and escaped when they found the bodies lying in a pool of blood in different bedrooms. On information, the Bidadi police reached the spot and conducted spot investigations.

Investigations revealed that the murder could have taken place the previous night and the accused had used a hammer to bludgeon them to death. The accused then ransacked the house to search for valuables and even consumed alcohol and stayed until the security guards came to the villa to check, the police said.

The bodies were shifted for post-mortem and will be handed over to the family members on Wednesday and a special team has been formed to track down the assailant.
