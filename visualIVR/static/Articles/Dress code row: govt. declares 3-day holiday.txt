Mr. Bommai appealed to all those concerned, especially students, to patiently wait for the court’s verdict. He reminded them that they have to sit together in colleges and carry on with educational activities, and hence, it was important to maintain harmony. He strongly defending the recent order of the government on dress code in colleges.

The Opposition has, meanwhile, lambasted the BJP government for escalation of the issue and “colleges turning into battlefield.” Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets said, “Hijab-Kesari issue could have been resolved harmoniously at the local level. BJP in Karnataka, which politicized the issue, is now clueless on how to control the situation.” He added that students were suffering because of “ulterior political motives of the BJP.”

JDS leader H.D. Kumaraswamy said the controversy has diverted the focus of the State from many challenges it faces and vitiated the atmosphere in colleges. “I appeal to both communities not to encourage organizations that are fomenting trouble,” he said.
