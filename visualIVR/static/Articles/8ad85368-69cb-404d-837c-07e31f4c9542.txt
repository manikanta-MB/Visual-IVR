Janata Dal (Secular) MP H.D. Deve Gowda said in the Rajya Sabha that the Union government was ill-treating Karnataka when it came to water supply and river-linking projects. “To overcome the crisis of drinking water problem, the government of Karnataka has proposed to construct Mekedatu project at the border point. The Government of India has not yet taken a decision because you are objecting to it,” he said, referring to Tamil Nadu.
