A week after the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme received a Budget allocation 25% lower than the previous year’s revised estimates, a Parliamentary panel has pulled up the government, noting that Budget estimates for the Centre’s flagship rural jobs scheme have failed to keep up with proven demand for the last four to five years.

“Budgetary Allocation of a scheme of such enormous magnitude should be done in a more pragmatic manner so that there is no dearth of funds in mid-year, and flow of funds for payment of wages, material share, etc. is maintained seamlessly,” said a critical evaluation of the scheme presented to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development spotlighted the failure to pay unemployment allowances and also recommended a hike in wage rates and in the number of days of guaranteed work, and a revision of the 60:40 wage-material ratio under the scheme. The panel, chaired by Shiv Sena MP Prataprao Jadhav, adopted the report at its last meeting on February 4.
