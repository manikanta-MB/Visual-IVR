Sringeri tahsildar S.A. Prasad has filed a complaint against his predecessor Ambuja R. and five staff of the taluk office accusing them of creating false documents, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust. The police registered the complaint on February 6.

Ambuja R., the main accused, was Sringeri tahsildar until she was arrested by the ACB police on January 6. Other accused are revenue inspector Sandeep M.R., village accountants K.R. Sathish and Shivakumar V. Kavadi, and first divisional assistants Prakash R. and Sharath Kumar T.S..

Following allegations of corruption and irregularities in granting and regularising residential properties in the taluk, ACB police had caught village accountant Siddappa taking a bribe from a villager on January 6. Later, they arrested Ambuja R. as well. This development prompted Chikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner K.N. Ramesh to order a probe into allegations of irregularities in the taluk office, by a team of officers headed by Assistant Commissioner Dr.H.L. Nagaraj.

S.A. Prasad, the complainant, said between May 11, 2020, and January 6, 2022, the accused issued fake grant certificates without following the procedure. Flouting the law, they regularised houses in forest land, soppina betta, gram thana and regularised properties where houses are yet to be built. The accused caused a huge loss to the Government. They had not collected reports from their subordinates concerned before taking any decision.

Even as the inquiry was on, Vijeth, the tahsildarâ€™s driver died by suicide. He had left a note alleging harassment by some officials in the taluk office.
