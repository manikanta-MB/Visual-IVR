The newly appointed Vice- Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Santishree Dhulipudi Pandit has distanced herself from a controversial Twitter account in her name a day after her appointment. In a response on Tuesday to The Hindu ’s query about whether the unverified handle @SantishreeD belonged to her, she said “Not mine”.

After Dr. Pandit’s appointment was announced on Monday, the account, which used her full name and description as a professor, caused widespread outrage on Twitter. Screenshots of tweets using communal language and name-calling students, farmers, politicians and activists went viral on social media.

Dr. Pandit did not respond to further queries from The Hindu on whether she was aware of who was using the account and whether she had requested its deletion.

The account included tweets referring to a section of JNU teachers and students as “losers” and “extremist naxal groups” who should be banned from campuses.

Tweets termed so-called “love jihad” a “terror by other means”, Sunni Islam radical.

Criticism of China

China also came in for a lot of flak, being termed a “rogue nation”. Tweets referred to COVID-19 as the China virus and accused the country of “bioterror” and “biowarfare”.

In domestic politics, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi was repeatedly referred to as an “Italian remote control” and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal a “pathological liar”, with a tweet adding that no Hindu must vote for him. Protesting farm unions were described as parasitic middlemen, riffraff and liars.
