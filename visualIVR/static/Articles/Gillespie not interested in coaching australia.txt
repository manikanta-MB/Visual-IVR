Touted as one of the favourites to become the new Australian head coach, former paceman Jason Gillespie, on Tuesday, said he is not interested in the top job and described Justin Langer’s departure as “heartbreaking”.

Gillespie, who is South Australia’s coach and also has the experience of guiding English county sides Sussex and Yorkshire, was touted as a potential replacement for Langer along with Trevor Bayliss, Ricky Ponting, Greg Shipperd and Michael Di Venuto.

“I am not putting myself up for any job. It’s nice to be thought of in that way but it’s certainly something I am not even thinking about entertaining,” Gillespie was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo .

“Everyone has been pretty disappointed with how it has all played out — pretty heartbreaking to see, to be honest,” the 46-year-old Gillespie said.

“But unfortunately, it is what it is.

“Justin has handled himself very well, the decision has been made and whatever decision they make, they make.”

Better handling

“But I think everyone is of the opinion that things probably could have been handled better. He is okay.

“He felt he had something to offer Australian cricket. Cricket Australia felt differently.

“So move on. That’s part and parcel, I suppose, of being in professional sport and being a coach,” Gillespie added.
