Prime Minister Narendra Modi has mocked the Maharashtra government’s initiative to help the poor during the pandemic, the Congress party said on Tuesday.

“The Congress party and our State government took steps to help people in distress during the first wave of COVID. We provided them food, shelter and tickets to take them to their home so they can live with their loved ones. The BJP and Modi were busy lighting lamps and banging thalis at that time. The PM has made fun of workers and their poverty. He has made fun of Maharashtra’s efforts to help the poor...,” State Congress president Nana Patole said, adding that even the BJP leaders in the State should protest.

Mr. Modi’s remarks during his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address to both Houses of Parliament drew sharp reactions.

NCP Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule in Delhi said: “Mentioning Maharashtra as a super spreader of Corona was not only unfortunate but an insult of voters who had voted BJP in Lok Sabha polls to make you (Modi) Prime Minister.” She said the PM’s speech should have provided direction to the country for future, but instead he had insulted Maharashtra.

Stating that Railways came under the Central government, Ms. Sule said: “It was the Centre’s decision to arrange trains. The then Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and former CM Devendra Fadnavis have been praising the Railways for the same.”

“When Shramik Trains started, can the nation forget how these poor labourers who were left with no income were being charged for ticket? The State government stepped in to pay their fare,” tweeted Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi earlier on Monday.

Defending Mr. Modi, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar accused the three other parties of being instrumental in spreading the coronavirus in the entire country.

“These three parties are real anti-Maharashtra. These three parties brought the poor on road and made them go to their homes despite the COVID situation,” he said.
