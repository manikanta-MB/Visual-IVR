A day after referring to the Congress as the leader of the tukde tukde (break-up) gang in the Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday continued his attack against the Opposition party by recalling its history of dismissing State governments in the past, intolerance towards any criticism against its leadership and accused it of being in the grip of “urban naxals”.

“It is being said that we are trying to change history. The Congress thinking seems to have been hijacked by urban naxals. We just want to improve the memory of some people. We are not changing history. Some people’s history is limited to one family,” he said in the Rajya Sabha, replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address to Parliament.

Mr. Modi answered the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, who earlier asked what would have been the fate of the nation if Congress was not there during Independence. “I will tell you what would have happened if Congress wasn’t there — democracy would have been devoid of dynastic influence, we would be rid of foreign influence, there would be no Emergency, no caste and regional divide, no Sikh genocide would have taken place, Kashmir Pandits wouldn’t have been displaced, daughters would n’t have been killed in tandoor [oven] and common man would not have had to wait for years to get basic amenities” he said.
