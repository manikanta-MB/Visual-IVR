‘NDA govt. is a no data available government’

Former Finance Minister and Rajya Sabha MP P. Chidambaram said in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that the NDA government was a “no data available” government, citing government replies mentioning lack of data on deaths due to oxygen shortage and bodies floating in the rivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Referring to Mr. Modi’s speech mentioning jobs, Mr. Chidambaram said he should use the statistic of nearly 8 lakh government job vacancies in his next speech.
