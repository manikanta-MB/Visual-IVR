A student was hurt in stone-throwing at the Government Pre University College in Rabakavi Banahatti of Bagalkot district after the hijab-saffron shawl issue turned violent.

Unidentified people threw stones at the college after a row erupted in front of it during a protest by two groups of students. Some boys came to college wearing saffron shawls and demanded that they should be allowed inside classrooms.

When the college authorities refused to allow them saying that their dress was not in accordance with the uniform code, the boys said that the college had been allowing hijab-clad girls inside classes all these years, which was an obvious violation of the code.

“If these girls are allowed, then we should be allowed too,” they argued. They sat in protest in front of the college gate, demanding that the college authorities stop hijab-clad girls from entering the college.

In response, hijab-clad girls began a protest in front of the gates. After a few minutes, some people threw stones at the group and a boy suffered minor injuries.

The girls ran to safety. Police officers rushed to the spot and dispersed the crowd.
