Tripura tactics

Many BJP MLAs in Tripura want to quit the party but are holding back temporarily due to technical reasons, an ex-MLA who rejoined the Congress after quitting the saffron party said. Sudip Roy Barman, a five-time MLA and Ashish Kumar Saha resigned from the Assembly and the primary membership of the BJP on February 7. They accused the BJP of stifling democracy. “The entry of the two leaders from Tripura is just the beginning as many more from the BJP, CPI(M) and the Trinamool Congress will join our party,” party’s Tripura in-charge Ajay Kumar told journalists.
