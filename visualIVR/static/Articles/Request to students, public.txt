The High Court requested the student community and public at large to maintain peace and tranquillity in Karnataka when the court is hearing the legal arguments on the ban on wearing hijab in colleges.

“This court has full faith in the wisdom and virtue of the public at large, and hopes that the same would be put to practice,” Justice Dixit said in his brief order after the A-G, at the end of the hearing, pointed out that there is a need for the court to restrain protests and demonstrations, which may lead to a law and order issue when the court is hearing the matter.
