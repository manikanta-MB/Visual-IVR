EID Parry (India) Ltd. reported third-quarter standalone net profit shrank 95% to Rs. 18 crore, from Rs. 339 crore a year earlier, after a one-time loss from the sale of a unit.

Revenue from operations rose 56% to Rs. 686 crore. The results included an exceptional item of Rs. 13.73 crore as loss on sale of plant and equipment at the Puducherry factory of the holding company, EID Parry said in a filing.

“The company performed better than the corresponding quarter... on account of better realisation and higher volume of exports and alcohol sales,” said MD S. Suresh.
