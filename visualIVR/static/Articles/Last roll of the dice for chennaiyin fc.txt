It is the last roll of the dice for both Chennaiyin FC and FC Goa when they meet at the Tilak Maidan on Wednesday.

With just five matches remaining for both sides, they need to maximise the points haul from these games starting with this fixture.

Chennaiyin is eighth on the points table, one place ahead of Goa but quite some way off the leaders in its pursuit of a place in the knockouts.

Bozidar Bandovic’s men will come into the game on the back of a 0-1 defeat to Mumbai City FC.

The head coach conceded his side’s chances for a place in the semifinals now looks difficult but promised to put the best foot forward.

“It is difficult, but there is always a chance. We have to give everything. We have five more games. Last game, we made so many mistakes with the ball in our feet and under no pressure. This is one thing we need to fix for the future,” said Bandovic.
