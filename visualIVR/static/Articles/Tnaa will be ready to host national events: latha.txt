The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has allotted three events to Tamil Nadu — two Grands Prix (Madurai, May 18 and 25) and a National inter-State championship (Chennai, June 10 to 14).

C. Latha, secretary, Tamil Nadu Athletics Association (TNAA), said they will be ready to successfully host all three National events.

“The long jump pit and runway track at the SDAT-MGR Stadium in Madurai has a bit of reworking to be done, while the track and the field at the SDAT-Nehru Stadium in Chennai are largely in fine shape,” Latha told The Hindu on Tuesday.

TNAA will release its calendar on Friday.
