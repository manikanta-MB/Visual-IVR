Social media accounts of the Army’s Srinagar based 15 Corps, popularly known as Chinar Corps, on Facebook and Instagram have been blocked for over 10 days now, officials said on Tuesday. “The accounts have been blocked since January 28 and the bot [automated] reply only says they have not followed the guidelines. But there has been no official communication as to why they have been blocked,” an Army official said.
