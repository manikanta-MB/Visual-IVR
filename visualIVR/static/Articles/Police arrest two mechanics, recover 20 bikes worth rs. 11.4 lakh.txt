The Chamrajpet police on Tuesday arrested two mechanics who used to steal motorcycles parked in front of houses. The police have recovered 20 bikes worth Rs. 11.4 lakh from them.

Based on a theft case reported on January 18, the police analysed CCTV footage before zeroing in on Ramadasa and Shravan, aged 20 years. The duo confessed that they were stealing parked bikes for the last six months and selling it to people at throwaway prices. The accused would then use the money on vices and steal the next bike after running out of cash, the police said.

Further investigations are under way.
