Taking on global rating agencies for terming India the most indebted emerging market and claiming that the Union Budget lacked clarity on fiscal consolidation plans, Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan said they appear to adopt “double standards” in their assessments of emerging economies and developed markets.

“India, in fact, has one of the best debt-to-GDP ratios if compared against higher-rated countries like the U.S. and Japan, and has a natural tendency to grow faster than them even in the worst of times,” he said.

He stressed there was no ambiguity in the Centre’s fiscal glide path to attain the target deficit of 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.
