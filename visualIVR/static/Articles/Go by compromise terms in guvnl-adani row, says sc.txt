The Supreme Court on Tuesday disposed of a curative petition concerning the row between Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. (GUVNL), the State’s power utility, and Adani Group’s power company after noting that both parties had reached an amicable out-of-court settlement and their relationship would be governed by the terms of the compromise.

A Special Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana passed the order in a curative petition filed by the GUVNL against a July 2019 judgment of the Supreme Court upholding the termination of a power purchase agreement by Adani Power (Mundra) Limited.

In September last year, the Curative Bench led by CJI Ramana had, in a rare move, issued notice to the Adani group and decided to hear the case in open court.

However, both the GUVNL and Adani reached an amicable settlement of the 1000 MW power purchase agreement in January 2022. It was reported that the Adani group had decided to waive the Rs. 12,000 crore compensation that the GUVNL was ordered by the Supreme Court to pay in 2019. Following the settlement, the GUVNL and Adani moved the Supreme Court jointly, seeking modification of the 2019 judgment.

Prior to the case reaching the SC, the GUVNL had won its challenge against the termination in the Gujarat State Electricity Regulatory Commission.
