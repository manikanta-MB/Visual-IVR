‘Only BJP can provide stable government in Goa’

Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that only the BJP could give Goa a stable and development-oriented government. The Minister was speaking at the release of the party’s manifesto for the State on Tuesday. The saffron party has made 22 resolutions (to chime with its stated aim of winning 22-plus seats in the 2022 election) for Goa’s development. The resolutions include good quality housing for the poor.
