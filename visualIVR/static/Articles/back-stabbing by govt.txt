The late-night demolition of NTM School, a government-run school, on N.S. Road in Mysuru has come under sharp criticism with those in favour of saving the historic Kannada school expressing shock as several writers and progressive organisations had been urging the government to safeguard it.

“The demolition of NTM School has come as a shock. It is nothing but back-stabbing by the government,” said Malavika Gubbivani, district president, AAP Mysuru.

“Activists trusted the government and believed that talks were still on, but the government went ahead and demolished the school, that too at night, demonstrating a cowardly approach. For years, people of Mysuru have been urging the government and elected representatives to protect and improve the NTM School. Unfortunately, successive governments and politicians of all parties — Congress, BJP and JD(S) — have failed to protect the school. This shows how much these politicians value education, ”she said.

At a time when more government schools are needed and the focus should have been on improving the infrastructure and quality of education in government schools, AAP accused the BJP government of doing the exact opposite. The CM could have single-handedly saved the school if he had the resolve, Ms. Gubbivani held. With the demolition of the historic school, a part of Mysuru’s history — the dawn of education for the girl child in Karnataka — has been erased, she opined.
