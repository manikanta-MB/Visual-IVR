The Samajwadi Party has pledged to make every farmer in Uttar Pradesh debt-free by 2025, introduce a law to guarantee minimum employment in urban areas and reserve 33% of all government jobs, including the police, for women.

With a focus on the rural economy and workers, the SP has also promised to provide two bags of DAP and five bags of urea free of cost for farmers with less than two acres of land, create a corpus fund of Rs. 10,000 crore to ensure that sugarcane farmers are paid their dues within 15 days and provide Rs. 25 lakh each to the family of farmers who died in the farmers protest.

SP chief Akhilesh Yadav released his partyâ€™s manifesto here with an eye on the unemployed youth and addressing costs of urban living. He said his party if voted to power would bring an urban employment guarantee act along the lines of MNREGA.

The SP manifesto also promised two free LPG cylinders per year for BPL families, one litre petrol every month to persons owning a two-wheeler and three litres of free petrol to every auto rickshaw driver.
