A girl arriving at a college in Mandya clad in hijab was heckled by a group of boys wearing saffron scarves on Tuesday. The girl was walking towards the classroom after parking her two-wheeler when the boys began waving saffron scarves at her. The girl, as seen in videos that have gone viral, raised her hand in response to the sloganeering directed at her by the boys.

She is later seen in a video complaining about the treatment meted out to her before she made her way to the classroom. The incident took place in PES College of Arts, Science and Commerce situated on Mysuru-Bengaluru highway.

The girl, talking to media later, said five other girls who came to the college with hijab, were also subjected to similar treatment and reduced to tears.

However, she said she received support from not only the college principal and other staff, but also her Hindu classmates. She denied that she was feeling unsafe and added that education is her priority while lamenting the efforts made to ruin education in the name of attire.

Inspector General of Police (Southern Range) Praveen Madhukar Pawar said the incident was part of the controversy that is gripping Karnataka. He denied that there was any tension in the college.
