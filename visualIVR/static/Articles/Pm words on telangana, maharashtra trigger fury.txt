Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks during his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address to Parliament drew sharp reactions from the main political parties in Telangana and Maharashtra on Tuesday.

In Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the Congress took strong objection to Mr. Modi’s remarks on the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, demanding an unconditional apology. State Finance and Health Minister T. Harish Rao criticised the Prime Minister for “spewing venom” against Telangana, saying that the Centre had denied the State its due.

The Centre was insisting on electricity meters for agricultural connections to release the grants, but the State government turned it down, he said.

State Congress chief A. Revanth Reddy said: “The comments on Telangana expose that the Prime Minister has no respect for elected bodies or Parliament.”

He said the BJP had came up with the slogan “one vote, two States” in 1998, but deceived the people after coming to power the next year.

“The party which ensured formation of three other States did not keep its commitment on Telangana. The lives of 1,200 plus people, who died for the cause of Telangana, could have been saved had the BJP kept its promise of bifurcation then,” he said.

Responding to Mr. Modi’s statement about the spread of COVID-19 during the first wave, all three major parties in Maharashtra demanded an apology from him and the BJP for making “snide” comments against the State. The Congress said it would hold protests outside the BJP offices across Maharashtra on Wednesday.
