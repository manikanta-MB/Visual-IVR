As electioneering intensifies in Punjab in the run-up to the Assembly election on February 20 , a new factor has emerged, adding colour to the political rivalry. The distinct colours of turbans, an intrinsic part of the Sikh religion and culture, are setting the tone for the elections as they are seen as symbols of political affiliation.

The century-old Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is associated with the blue colour, the Aam Aadmi Party connects with yellow, while the Congressmen favour white or light blue turbans.

The colour of turbans at political rallies are a way of signifying the political narrative, besides a show of strength and display of alignment by the supporters of political parties.

The SAD cadre initially were associated with black turbans as a mark of protest against the British during the ‘Morcha Chabian’, a campaign for the recovery of the keys of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) treasury in the early 1920s.

In the later years, the SAD inclined towards the blue and orange ( kesari ), which is allied with the ‘Panthic’ (Sikhism) ideology.

Bhagwant Mann, State president of the AAP and Lok Sabha member, who has been announced as the party’s chief ministerial candidate, has led the party’s association with yellow, which members said symbolises ‘revolution’.

According to the party members, the colour is associated with basant, or spring, the season of renewal after winter.

Congress leaders and cadre have been traditionally sported white turbans to differentiate themselves from the Akali Dal. Congress leaders, including former President Giani Zail Singh, former Chief Ministers Pratap Singh Kairon and Beant Singh, were mostly seen donning the white turban. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, was among those who wore a distinct light blue turban.
