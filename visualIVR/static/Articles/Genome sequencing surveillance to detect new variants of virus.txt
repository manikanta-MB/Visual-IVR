Following directions from the Centre, Karnataka Government has directed all ICMR-approved COVID-19 testing labs in the State to send 10% of all positive samples, identified from February 2 to February 28, for genome sequencing.

This is as part of a special genome sequencing surveillance drive to enable detection of new variants proactively.

Karnataka has been given a target of 10,000 samples in February.

“As of now, routine genome sequencing is being undertaken with 15 samples fortnightly from each district. However, the Centre has now instructed the State to conduct a special genome sequencing surveillance of COVID-19 with a larger proportion of positive samples,” stated a circular issued in Bengaluru on February 7.

“Samples of patients with international travel history (irrespective of CT value); representative samples from clusters / focal outbreaks with severe morbidity and / or mortality; seriously sick, hospitalised patients and prolonged hospital admissions should be prioritised. Besides, samples from cases of re-infection; breakthrough infections (in fully vaccinated individuals) and from COVID-19 death cases should also be sent for sequencing,” the circular stated.

Meanwhile, following recommendations by the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), all District Health and Family Welfare Officers, Mental Health Programme Officers along with District and Taluk Mental Health Program (DMHP) teams have been directed to ensure uninterrupted availability of out-patient mental health services.

Hospitals can also practice telephonic consultation, telemedicine services and e-prescription as per the existing telemedicine guidelines provided.
