The II Pre-University examinations in Karnataka will start on April 16 and conclude on May 6.

The Department of Pre-University Education on Tuesday issued the final timetable for the examination.

The announcement of exam dates comes amidst a raging controversy over dress codes in colleges, with girls in some pre-university colleges in coastal Karnataka and elsewhere not being allowed to enter classrooms wearing hijab and boys turning up in saffron shawls as a counter to hijab.

Academic activity was already disrupted owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Language subjects

With the pandemic throwing the academic calendar out of gear, the Government had decided to reduce the syllabus by 30% for language subjects. However, for optional subjects, the examination will be conducted without any cut in syllabus.

Last year, the Karnataka Government had cancelled the II PU examination, while SSLC students had to appear for two papers based on a multiple-choice question format.

Before this, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) had cancelled their respective class XII board examination in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19. This had resulted in parents and students in Karnataka urging the Government to take a similar decision.

Impact on academics

Meanwhile, this yearâ€™s II PU exam timetable has raised concerns among students over the impact it will have on the rest of the academic calendar, especially with regards to entrance exams.

Some students have expressed anxiety over not having enough time to prepare for them.
